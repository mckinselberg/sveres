Here’s how I’d continue decomposing `Canvas.jsx` without changing behavior, in small, low‑risk steps.

Checklist (remaining):

- Extract small, focused hooks for input bridging (jump mechanics)
- Add minimal tests where behavior becomes pure

Recommended steps:

1. Jump mechanics inside Canvas (extract)

- Add `src/hooks/useJumpMechanics.js`:
  - Encapsulate the double-jump token, cooldowns, and apply jump impulse to the controlled ball
  - Canvas’s imperative `jumpPlayer()` just calls into this hook.

2. Imperative API wrapper

- Add `src/hooks/useImperativeCanvasAPI.js`:
  - Wraps updateSelectedBall, resetBalls, addBall, removeBall, applyColorScheme, jumpPlayer, etc.
  - Keeps the ref handling cohesive and easier to test.

3. Tests

- Add unit tests:
  - `levelPositioning.test.js` for anchors/percent/center offsets
  - `powerups.test.js` for pickup application and shield consumption edge case
  - `bulletHellSpawner.test.js` for spawn cadence and direction

Order of operations to minimize risk:

- 1 (jump hook)
- 2 (imperative API wrapper)
- 3 (tests)

Public contracts to keep stable:

- Props currently received by `Canvas`
- Imperative ref methods: jumpPlayer, updateSelectedBall, resetBalls, addBall, removeBall, applyColorScheme, onSelectedBallMotion callback shape

If you want, I can start with the jump hook and the imperative API wrapper, then add the tests and report deltas.

vital bugs to fix:

- fix reset issue where the balls keep speeding up leading to a frozen browser. i think the changes intended to improve performance actually ruined it.

nice-to-haves:

- welcome screen
- organize
- add wasd controls (W to jump alias)
- create music using simple bleep/bloops
- add ability to change the fps

later

- in game mode, if player does not interact with the canvas when the application starts
